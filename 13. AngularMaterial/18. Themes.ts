// Themes

// In Angular Material we have a concept called => Theme
// Theme is basically a collection of various color palettes
// We have the following color palettes:
//  - Primary => Refers to a color that appears most frequently in our app
//  - Secondary => Use to give some accent to certain key elements in the UI => e.x often used for buttons, progress bars, sliders, highited things
//  - Warn => Give warnings to the user => e.x error in an input field

// We can have for example => 3 shades of the primary color => mid-tone and a dark shade, light shade 
// This color palette helps us to keep consistly look in our app
// So if in a future we want to modify the primary color => we just need to modify in 1 place
//                                                       => Then all our components will automatically adopte the new color palette

// We can import a theme or create a custom theme that gives character to our app 
// To design the color palette => we need to use the color tool on => material.io/color website => color tool


// Color tool 
// In the left side => we can navigate and see different example of User Interfaces
//                  => to give us an idea how our theme looks like
// Look on the top of color palette => every color has different versions or shapes
//                                  => 50(lightest) and 900(darkest)
// In right-below side => we have primary and secondary => to select the secondary we need to select a primary color first
// Example:
// primary color => blue =>  scroll down and find the blue => select one => 600 blue
// secondary color => lets use yellow 
//                 
// We need to remember the number(version) of the color  => because we need to reference it exactly
//                                              => when we're going to make a custom theme
//                                              => All these colors are predefined in Material Design guideline => they all have name and version
//
