// We have seen a few of the Built-in modules in Angular:
// Forms Module
// ReactiveForms Module
// Http Module
// Router Module => Time to explore it

// In Router Module we have a bunch of Directive and Services => We use for  implementing navigation in our app
// There're three steps to implement navigation:
// 1. Configure the routes in our app => Each route determinates what component should be visible when user navigate to a certain url
//    A route is the mapping of the path to a component
// 2. Add a router outlet => Where we display the corresponding component when a given route become active 
// 3. Add links
