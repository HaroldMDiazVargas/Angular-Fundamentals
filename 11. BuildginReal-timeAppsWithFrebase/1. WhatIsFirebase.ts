// The architecture of an app => consist of two parts 
// 1. Front-end => Sits on client => We use angularto build it
// 2. Back-end => Sits on the server => We use different set of languages and frameworks to build it 
// The frontend talks to backend to get or save data by of a bunch of HTTP Services 
// Behind these HTTP Services we have 1 or more databases => such as => SQL Server, Mongo, Raven, so on.

// Front-end -----------> Back-end ------------> Database
//           <---------- Back-end  <------------

// This is the architecture of most app out there

// As a front-end developer => dont worry about the backend
// Building backend is time consuming => that's where we Firebase shines
// With firebase => we can build our backend for our angular apps => in less than 1 minute 
//               => super fast, scalable and real-time on the cloud => and a library to talks to this in angular apps
//               => On top of that, we also get authentication
//               => cloud messagin => for sending notification
//               => storage => for storing our files
//               => analytics
//               => Provide libraries for iOs, Android, JS and C++
//               => We can get most of these features for free => If our app grows => we can either pay 20 usd at month or subscription modal
