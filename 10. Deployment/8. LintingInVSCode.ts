//Lint our code directly in VSCode

// Install TSLint extension 
// So we can see e.x trailing whitespace indicated by red underline 
// other e.x if we change string to double quotes => we can see a left command => to activate it => Ctrl+. => suggest to fix double quote to single or suggest disable rule
// A faster way to fix errors in a file => using the command pallete => shift+ctrl+p => search tslint
// we can see 3 commands:
// TSLint: Fix all auto-fixable problems => with this fix all issues in one go
// TSLint: Create 'tslint.json' file
// TSLint: Show output

// But even with this extension is a good practice to run in terminal lint => before commit to our repository
