# ðŸš€ Command line to creating a directive

To create a new directive use the next command line:

```
ng g d directiveName
```

This creates two files:

- src/app/directiveName.directive.spec.ts (unit)
- src/app/directiveName.directive.ts
- Also register in src/app/app.module.ts (NgModure => Inside declarations array)
